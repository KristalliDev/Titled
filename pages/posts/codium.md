## About

[Codeium](https://https://codeium.com) is a new fre* AI code assistant. You might have noticed the "*" on "free" there as in the FAQ of [codeium](https://www.codeium.com) it both says it will stay free as well as it will be free for early adapters. This, has me quite confused so, I decided to just state both of it. Though, you may call it dumb and call me dumb in which case *insert mirror emoji here* uvu.

## Is it good?

Yes, it's free. Good enough for me heh.
But seriously is it good? Well, if we check the [comparsion](https://www.codeium.com/compare) at their [website](https://www.codeium.com/) we can see compared to the existing and popular code AI assistants it fairs pretty well sometimes doing evne better. Though, personally as someone who has used three out of four comparisions there I can say yes, indeed it is good.

## Random

 I was pretty disapointed [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) was announced to be a paid based service and my trail was coming to an end soon. Butt, heh butt, I was lucky enough to stumble upon [Codium](https://www.codeium.com/) (Yes, evey time I mention one of these I will link them :D) on YouTube by [DevOnDuty](https://www.youtube.com/@devonduty) the video can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9Bx1by1XYc) (Hope, I don't get a law suit on my hands for mentioning it lol).

 ## TL;DR

 [Codeium](https://www.codeium.com) is a brand new AI code assistant and as of early 2023 it is free to use. It is able to beat or compete with the other popular AI code assistants. Personally, would recommend it butt, I'm just a random internet stranger no need to listen to me ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
